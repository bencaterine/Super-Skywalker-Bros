Super Skywalker Bros.

Help Luke return home!
Luke Skywalker has finished a long day of moisture farming, and he's ready to go home.
But on the way, he encounters a pack of Jawas!
Help Luke defeat the Jawas and make it home in time to watch the sunsets!

Controls:
Press RIGHT ARROW to move Luke to the right.
Press UP ARROW to make Luke jump. He will also move to the right as he jumps.
Press SHIFT to pause the game.
PRESS SPACE to resume.

Luke needs to jump on the Jawas' heads to defeat them.
But be careful: if Luke runs into a Jawa head-on, they'll zap him, and he'll return to the start of the game!
Also be sure not to let Luke fall off the edge of a platform. You'll have to restart!

Hurry! Luke needs to complete the game and get home to watch the sunsets.
May the Force be with you!
